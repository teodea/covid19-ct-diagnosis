This neural network program uses CT lung scans from real patients to distinguish between patients affected by Covid-19 and "normal" patients.
To gain further insight into the decision-making process of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the PyTorch Grad-CAM tool available at https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam was used.
